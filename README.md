# README

A half-baked solution to the "transposed marking" idea.

## Introduction

Have you been having to mark a single exercise for all students? Has it bugged 
you that Classy is not set up for this? Well, do I ever have a half-baked 
partially functional solution for you!

This code fetches one file from each student, for the course you're TAing. From 
each file, it exctracts the cells corresponding to the exercise you're supposed 
to mark. It gathers them all in some HTML pages (By default, 15 
exercises/students per HTML page to manage the page's filesize). Then, you can 
simply open up the HTML page(s) and see all of the students' answers together
in one place.

## Get up and running

Set `gh_uname` to be your GitHub username on `github.ubc.ca`. Set `course_num`,
`exercise_num` and `lab_num` appropriately. For technical reasons, it is 
preferable if the first two are type `str` and the latter type `int` (but it 
shouldn't matter). 

You can set `fname` manually if you need to. By default, it is set to recognize 
files like `'*lab##*.ipynb'` (*e.g.,* `fname` would need to be modified if the 
submitted assignment is an Rmd file). 

In order to use the `PyGithub` package, you need to load your password into the 
script. To do this, create a file `ghubcmds.pw` in the same directory as the 
script, which contains your password. By default, this repository's `.gitignore` 
is set to ignore `*.pw` files so that one is not accidentally committed to 
remote. Modify the function `load_ghpw` so that it recognizes your GitHub 
(Enterprise)Â username. 

Finally, the script also requires a csv file (called `classy.csv`), which you 
can download from the main [classy page](//mds1.cs.ubc.ca). This is simply a 
list of all the students' GitHub (Enterprise) usernames. 

After modifying the elements above, run the script as:
```bash
python3 write_exercise_to_html.py
```

The output of the script appears in a new folder:  
`./DSCI{course_num}/Lab{lab_num}/{...}_page##.html`  
`./DSCI{course_num}/Lab{lab_num}/style##.css`

## Known Issues

* Does not search for auxiliary content (such as images that are not embedded
  in the notebooks). 
* Not a robust regex for recognizing exercise start/end cells; could be broken. 
* MathJax browser plug-in does not always recognize/format LaTeX code. 
* High level: this still doesn't solve the issue of having to navigate classy 
  in order to input the grades. I tried doing this with Selenium, but something
  in Classy's javascript prevents this from being "simple". If you think you 
  know how to solve or work around this snag, I'd love to hear about it!
* Find other issues? Create one and I'll do my best to be responsive to them. :-)

## Obligatory disclaimer

While I haven't had any problems so far, I suspect it *may* be possible for a 
lab submission to "break" how this module works. As such, use it at your own 
risk. This code is not responsible (nor am I) for any content that is 
missing or altered in the HTML output.
